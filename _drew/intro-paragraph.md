## Short Neck Hangers Save Closet Space

- Higher Hangers are clothes hangers reinvented. Since 1869, hangers have had a design flaw that wastes space. Higher Hangers are the first hangers ever to be designed around optimally efficient closet geometry. Higher Hangers have a patented space saving geometry that <strong>creates room for 48 shoe boxes (or 7 carry-on pieces of luggage) in an average closet.</strong> <a class="page-scroll" href="#calculator">Calculate how much space you can create in your own closet here...</a>
- All you do is swap your hangers with Higher Hangers. The short neck raises your clothes <strong>higher</strong> to reduce clutter & wrinkles, & to increase available storage space. While maximizing efficiency, Higher Hangers retain the same classic utility of traditional hangers as they work with all styles of clothing, including collared shirts.
