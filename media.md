Higher Hangers are clothes hangers reinvented. Since 1869, hangers have had a design flaw that wastes space. Higher Hangers have a patented space-saving geometry that creates room for 48 shoe boxes in an average closet. All you do is replace your hangers with Higher Hangers. They work by lowering the hanger hook, which raises clothes higher, creating new space underneath. The design maximizes efficiency while retaining function with all styles of clothing, including collared shirts.

**Long**

Drew Cleaver invented Higher Hangers while living a cramped new life in his freshman dorm room. In 2008, his patent was issued in less than a year after its first application, something unheard of at the time. His senior year, he and his team won the undergrad D.W. Reynold’s Tri-State Business plan competition with Higher Hangers and were awarded nearly $40,000 in cash. 

In 2010 he won a product search competition hosted by a major housewares retailer, but they were not able to bring Higher Hangers to market due to higher than anticipated levels of risk. In 2014 all Higher Hangers intellectual property was returned to Drew. After 6 years in oil & gas, Drew left the corporate world to bring Higher Hangers to market himself. 

Drew attended Cypress Creek High School in Houston, TX and graduated from John Brown University in 2009 with a B.S. in Business Management. He has lived in Denver, Colorado since 2012 and enjoys cycling, skiing, and motorsport.

## Press Release March 21, 2016 - The #1 Hangers in Kickstarter History

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

**These are the #1 Hangers in Kickstarter History**

Denver, CO - March 21, 2016 - Many have tried to launch a new style of clothes hanger on Kickstarter, but none has ever been as successful as Drew Cleaver's Higher Hangers. Within forty-eight hours after their launch, they blew past the previous record holder, the Helmet and Gear Hanger. 

While one in four hanger campaigns fail to even meet their fundraising goal, Higher Hangers has raised over 170% of their goal and currently sit at $69,000 and counting. They still have ten days left before their campaign ends on March 31.

What makes these hangers so special compared to others? Inventor Drew Cleaver has identified five things that set Higher Hangers apart:

1. Higher Hangers address a need many people have. Almost everyone wishes they had a bigger closet, and Higher Hangers free up valuable closet space.
2. Higher Hangers make a big difference. The space savings isn't just a little bit. Higher Hangers create enough new space in an average closet for 48 shoe boxes, and even more if it is a walk-in style closet.
3. Higher Hangers have mass appeal. Many hangers on Kickstarter only appealed to certain sub-groups, like kids, motorcycle enthusiasts, or people looking for an accessory hanger. Higher Hangers benefit anyone who has a closet.
4. Higher Hangers are simple to use. Some new designs of hangers are so complicated to use that people shy away from them. On the other hand, Higher Hangers work just like traditional clothes hangers without losing any utility. Yes, they even work with collared shirts.
5. Higher Hangers are priced right. Based on how many hangers backers get at different reward tiers, Higher Hangers are the most affordable compared to all previous hangers.

Add these factors up, and you get the most successful hangers in Kickstarter history. 

Here’s how they work: Higher Hangers have a patented design that has a recessed hook, raising the clothes hanger 4-5 inches (or more) over traditional clothes hangers, getting rid of wasted vertical space between the closet rod and clothes. 

Cleaver went through multiple design revisions to arrive at the perfect hanger. “Since inventing Higher Hangers trying to save space in my dorm room, I’ve been my toughest critic and made sure Higher Hangers had the utility of traditional clothes hangers,” says Cleaver.

Right now, there are two different kinds of Higher Hangers: Velvet-Flocked Slimline and Heavy Duty Engineered Wood Composite (HDF). Built with a popular nonslip coating with a slim profile, velvet Higher Hangers work well with dresses, pants, strap tops, or anything that tends to fall off a plastic hanger, like most women’s tops & all pants. The thin profile allows more clothes to hang side to side, allowing some people to double or triple closet space laterally.

The HDF Higher Hangers are one solid piece of wood composite, plus the hook, making a highly durable hanger built to last. They are ideal for dress or collared shirts, t-shirts, coats, or anything with sleeves. Rather than typical wood hangers, which are two to three pieces of wood glued together, HDF Higher Hangers are made from a single piece, making them tougher than most wood hangers.

Since launching on Kickstarter, over 30,000 Higher Hangers have been backed from 16 countries. You can take advantage of early bird discounts up to 50% off the retail price by backing Higher Hangers on Kickstarter for as little as $15. The campaign ends March 31.

- **We All Need These New Space-Saving Clothes Hangers In Our Closet**

Sub: The Internet is going crazy for these space-saving clothes hangers.

Denver, Colorado, March 9, 2016 - Everyone wishes their closet was bigger. We buy bins for storage, slimline hangers to fit more clothes, and install custom shelving to make the most of what little room we have in our closets. A new hanger design is taking the internet by storm by saving vertical space over traditional clothes hangers.

How much space? According to the inventor, in a typical master bedroom closet, Higher Hangers will save 11 cubic feet, which is enough space for 7 pieces of carry on luggage or 48 shoe boxes. Who wouldn’t want more room for 48 shoe boxes in their closet?

Here’s how it works: Higher Hangers have a patented design that has a recessed hook, raising the clothes hanger 4-5 inches (or more) over a traditional clothes hangers, eliminating the wasted vertical space between the closet rod and garments. You might think that the design wouldn’t work with collared shirts, but the inventor, Drew Cleaver, is a guy who wears collared shirts and made sure to take that into account. He went thought multiple design revisions to arrive at the perfect hanger. “Since inventing Higher Hangers trying to save space in my dorm room, I’ve been my toughest critic and made sure Higher Hangers retained the utility of traditional clothes hangers,” says Cleaver.

Right now, there are two different kinds of Higher Hangers: Velvet-Flocked Slimline and Heavy Duty Engineered Wood Composite (HDF).

The HDF Higher Hangers are one solid wood composite piece, plus the hook, making a highly durable hanger built to last. They are ideal for dress or collared shirts, t-shirts, coats, or anything with sleeves. Rather than typical wood hangers, which are two to three pieces of wood glued together, HDF Higher Hangers are made from a single piece, giving greater durability.

People love these hangers so much that they blew past their Kickstarter goal of $40,000 in the first few days. They are currently at over $56,000 pledged, 142% of goal, and over 30,000 Higher Hangers preordered from 16 countries with three weeks left in the campaign. You can take advantage of early bird discounts up to 50% off the retail price by backing Higher Hangers on Kickstarter for as little as $25. The campaign ends March 31.

## Press Release March 9, 2016 - Design

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

Suggested Headlines:

- **These Hangers Are Changing Custom Closet Design**
- **New Clothes Hangers Create More Space In Your Closet**

Denver, Colorado, March 9, 2016 - A new clothes hanger design claims to help people create enough new space in the average closet to fit an additional forty-eight shoe boxes. Named Higher Hangers, they have a patented recessed hook that raises clothes hangers four to five inches (ten to thirteen centimeters) or more compared to traditional clothes hangers. 

The design of the hanger is simple and elegant. Rather than a complicated contraption, Higher Hangers retain the same functionality and simplicity as traditional clothes hangers. Higher Hangers are designed to work with all styles of clothing including pants and collared shirts. 

Inventor Drew Cleaver tells how he came up with the idea: "I was in my college dorm room running out of space. I looked into my closet and saw wasted space between the clothes rod and the hanging height of my clothes." Cleaver then hacked an existing plastic clothes hanger with pliers and melted it back together using a lighter to create the first prototype. 

Multiple design revisions followed, each aimed at making the hanger more user-friendly. "I wanted Higher Hangers to work exactly like traditional clothes hangers, with no tradeoffs," says Cleaver. His final design yielded two styles of Higher Hangers: 
Velvet-Flocked Slimline and Heavy Duty Engineered Wood Composite (HDF).

Built with a popular nonslip coating and possessing a slim profile, velvet Higher Hangers work well with dresses, pants, strap tops, or anything that tends to fall off a plastic hanger, such as women's tops & all pants. The thin profile allows more clothes to hang side to side, helping some people to double or triple closet space laterally.

The HDF Higher Hangers are one solid wood composite piece, plus the hook, making a highly durable hanger built to last. They are ideal for dress or collared shirts, t-shirts, coats, or anything with sleeves. Rather than typical wood hangers, which are two to three pieces of wood glued together, HDF Higher Hangers are made from a single piece, giving greater durability.

Higher Hangers launched on Kickstarter and raised $40,000 in only three days. Potential customers can order their Higher Hangers at steep discounts, up to fifty percent off retail price, through March 31 at their Kickstarter page, http://kck.st/1SdfGfN. Learn more at www.HigherHangers.com

## Press Release March 9, 2016 - General

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

**College Student Invents Space-Saving Clothes Hanger in Dorm Room**

Denver, Colorado, March 9, 2016 - Have you ever looked at your closet and wished it was bigger? Drew Cleaver did the same thing when he moved into his first college dorm room (built before World War II). With no room alterations allowed, Drew had to find a way to make new space out of nothing. 

After gazing at his tiny closet, he noticed something odd: his traditional clothes hangers left a large gap between his garments and the closet rod. "I thought to myself, 'That’s all wasted space,'" said Cleaver. At that point, he invented Higher Hangers. Higher Hangers eliminate all that wasted space by bringing the hanger hook closer to the garment, raising the clothes higher, which creates about 11 cubic feet of new space in an average closet. That's enough for forty-eight shoe boxes or seven carry-on pieces of luggage.

"The most important thing about Higher Hangers is that they are not a contraption or gimmick that you add to your existing toolbox of organizational accessories," Cleaver says. Higher Hangers are clothes hangers reinvented. They are meant as a direct replacement for existing traditional clothes hangers. The design maximizes efficiency while retaining function with all styles of clothing, including collared shirts. There is no sacrifice with this amazingly simple yet brilliant “better mousetrap” invention. 

A few years ago, Higher Hangers won an innovative dorm room product search competition hosted by a major housewares retailer. Unfortunately, the retailer underestimated the amount of investment required to bring Higher Hangers to market the way they wanted to, so they ended up returning all the rights back to Cleaver. 

Now, he has launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise the money needed to bring Higher Hangers to market. Within three days, Cleaver raised the $40,000 needed to fund the first manufacturing order of Higher Hangers. The campaign lasts until until March 31, and customers can pre-order Higher Hangers at up to 50% off retail prices through their Kickstarter page, http://kck.st/1SdfGfN. You can also find out more on their website, www.HigherHangers.com.

## Testimonials

### Product Testers

When I first discovered Higher Hangers I thought to myself, "Why on earth would anyone buy hangers with the old design?" It's a logical product that offers a quick solution to maximizing closet space. In NYC, where my clients' closets are typically very tight, this is a great product for them to increase shoe storage - something all women want!

Samantha Brown, Professional Stylist, SamanthaBrownStyle.com

As a women's clothing and accessories boutique owner, I'm always searching for hangers that won't damage clothing. Not only are Higher Hangers space-saving, the gentle shoulder design eliminates damage to lightweight knits, sweaters, and cotton garments. I'm now a Higher Hangers customer and will be recommending all of my customers to make the switch.

Elizabeth, Boutique Owner, SouthernHippie.com

We cram two adults, a baby, and a toddler in to a 204 sqft Tiny House! When it comes to space, we think in inches rather than feet, and every single inch matters! Higher Hangers has changed my closet! With the added space we are able to fit more in our teeny tiny closet! I will be forever grateful to Higher Hangers for the added space that we didn't know wasn't there! This design will become the new normal, I'm sure of it.

Baylie Carlson, TinyHouseGrowingFamily.com

As a professional organizer, space planning is a large part of my business. Clients hire me not only to organize, but also to make the most of the space available to them. I can't believe something as simple as Higher Hangers’ design could help me provide more useable space in a closet. Here in San Francisco, closet space is at a premium. Higher Hangers give me the ability to organize and create more space for shelving or shoe storage.

Samantha, Professional Organizer, SimplyOrganized.me
