title: What is your shipping & return policy?
---

Orders typically ship out the next business day and returns are allowed up to 30 days after delivery. You will receive tracking info as soon as it's available.&nbsp;

If you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase for any reason within 30 days of delivery, you can [fill out this form (click here)](https://higherhangers.wufoo.com/forms/skmlnm61ln0dlf/)&nbsp;to request a return and we will send a Return Merchandise Authorization shipping label for receiving efficiency. When we receive your products, we will issue a **100% refund for your original purchase**.<br><br>Similar to making a return to Amazon, return postage will need to be added to our shipping label by the customer.&nbsp;

\*Product must be in **original packaging in like-new condition with our RMA label applied**. See our full return policy, including for those outside the US 48, [by clicking here.](/returns.html)
