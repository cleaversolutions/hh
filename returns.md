## Kickstarter Return Info

Thank you to all of our Kickstarter backers for help getting Higher Hangers off the ground. Due to the nature of crowdfunding including the startup costs, fees, discounted pricing, and associated campaign costs, we cannot accept returns for Kickstarter rewards. More on Kickstarter Here

Kickstarter was used to raise funds for investing into our new business in hopes to make a profit in the future. In the Kickstarter community, the items that you receive after making a pledge are referred to as “rewards” because they are not purchases like using Amazon or a common, established retailer. They are gifts that are sent to our supporters as a token of appreciation for their help in getting our business off the ground.

We appreciate your understanding and the support you have given us, but if you do not initially like Higher Hangers, here are two things we ask you to consider in the spirit of crowdfunding…

1. Give Higher Hangers a chance. Your hangers have never really changed throughout your life. With a new design, some things might look different, but in all reality I can assure you that the design changes are to save space while not changing their basic function. The parts of the hanger that touch your clothes are virtually unchanged from classic hangers. Often times it’s just a matter of perception because of a new, different design. We ask you to please give them a chance.

2. Give your reward to a friend. Our products might not work for you, but there are many folks out there who find them very valuable. We’d love for you to share Higher Hangers with a friend of yours.

Thank you again for your support and understanding.
