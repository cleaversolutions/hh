Effective for orders placed on or after 4/25/18<br>&nbsp;

If you decide Higher Hangers are not for you within 30 days of delivery, we’re happy to offer you a **Full Refund for your original purchase**.<br><br>First, you need to request a Return Merchandise Authorization by [filling out the form, click here](https://higherhangers.wufoo.com/forms/skmlnm61ln0dlf). We will email you a return shipping label, and when we receive your item, you will get a **Full Refund for your original purchase**.

In the event of partially defective product (it's rare, but occasionally happens) i.e. a few hangers are lower quality than the majority, we will offer a proportional refund for defective product within the same 30 days. Contact us and let us know of the issue and include any pictures if you are able so that we can keep track and work with the factory to continually improve. We make hundreds of thousands of Higher Hangers at a pace of two per machine cycle, and the metal hooks on the slimlines are inserted by hand. We always strive for 100% perfection but occasionally human error happens.  

Product must be in **original packaging in like-new condition with our RMA shipping label**. See our full return policy, including for those outside the US 48, below.

## WITHIN THE US 48 (all states besides Alaska and Hawaii)

Within the US 48, we accept free returns for 30 days after receiving your order as indicated by the tracking information.

* To be eligible for a return, your item must be in&nbsp;**like-new condition & in the original packaging and utilize our provided RMA shipping label**. If any of these conditions aren't met, we unfortunately cannot receive your return as everything is automated and standardized for exact packaging. If anything is incorrect, the product is discarded. &nbsp;

To complete your return, simply click the “Return your Higher Hangers” link at the bottom of your order confirmation email. We will process a return merchandise authorization (RMA) and provide you with a return return shipping label which **will need postage applied, paid for by the customer, similiar to Amazon and most online merchants**. The return label will be emailed to you within approximately 2-3 business days after requesting. Simply attach our provided label to your original packaging and take it to a FedEx, USPS, or UPS location for return postage. We ask that you please ship the return within 7 days of receiving your return shipping label or be subject to a 25% restocking fee.

## Refunds

Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item and issued your refund.&nbsp;

Your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within 7 days for the full purchase amount. Orders that chose to pay for upgraded/expedited shipping options will be refunded less the upgraded shipping cost. Regardless of shipping method, we will provide an RMA shipping label for all returns within the US 48.

## OUTSIDE THE US 48 – Orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or outside the USA

Outside the US 48, we accept free returns for 30 days after receiving your order. The customer must pay all shipping charges, both for the original order and the return. 

Please make sure you are absolutely sure about your delivery address as Higher Hangers will not be able to intercept or refund international shipping charges for delivery issues related to errors. All risk of international shipping is held by the customer and cannot be refunded as it is a sunk cost.

## International Customers May be Responsible for VAT

Higher Hangers have been sold in over 35 countries and there is no way for us to collect or calculate VAT for everyone. If you're purchasing internationally, please expect to be responsible for VAT in your country when receiving the order. Due to size, ALL items are shipped as individual shipments because they cannot be combined.
